        <h1>More Than Basketball</h1>
        <p>Welcome to More Than Basketball, where we blend elite basketball training with Christian 
            teaching to develop players who excel on and off the court. Our gym is more than just a 
            place to practice; it's a community committed to fostering integrity, teamwork, and faith. 
            With experienced trainers, we empower athletes to reach their full potential, both as competitors 
            and as individuals. We also invite teams to rent our space for team practices or workouts.  
            Join us as we pursue excellence guided by Christ-centered principles at More Than Basketball.
